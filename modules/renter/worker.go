// 'standbyChunks' fields of the worker. The rest of the fields are only
// interacted with exclusively by the primary worker thread, and only one of
// those ever exists at a time.

// The workers have a concept of 'cooldown' for uploads and downloads. If a
// download or upload operation fails, the assumption is that future attempts
// are also likely to fail, because whatever condition resulted in the failure
// will still be present until some time has passed. Without any cooldowns,
// uploading and downloading with flaky hosts in the worker sets has
// substantially reduced overall performacne and throughput.
