// file in the folder. This will allow us to go one folder at a time and focus
// on problem areas instead of doing everything all at once every iteration.
// This should boost scalability.

// need to be checking for every piece within a contract, and checking that the

// lose or nullify the piece.

// TODO: Need to make sure that we wait for all standing upload jobs to
// complete in some way before we send off the next round of upload jobs.
// Otherwise we might end up with simultenously overlapping repair jobs.
