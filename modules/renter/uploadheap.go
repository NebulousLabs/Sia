// for each folder + file, where the folder scan time is the least recent time
// of any file in the folder, and the folder health is the lowest health of any
// file in the folder. This will allow us to go one folder at a time and focus
// on problem areas instead of doing everything all at once every iteration.
// This should boost scalability.

// TODO / NOTE: We need to upgrade the contractor before we can do this, but we
// need to be checking for every piece within a contract, and checking that the
// piece is still available in the contract that we have, that the host did not
// lose or nullify the piece.

// TODO: Renter will try to download to repair a piece even if there are not
// enough workers to make any progress on the repair.  This should be fixed.
