// difficulty.go defines the Oak difficulty adjustment algorithm. Past the
// hardfork trigger height, it the algorithm that Sia uses to adjust the
// difficulty.
//
// A running tally is maintained which keeps the total difficulty and total time
// passed across all blocks. The total difficulty can be divided by the total
// time to get a hashrate. The total is multiplied by 0.995 each block, to keep
// exponential preference on recent blocks with a half life of 144 data points.
// This is about 24 hours. This estimated hashrate is assumed to closely match
// the actual hashrate on the network.
//
// There is a target block time. If the difficulty increases or decreases, the
// total amount of time that has passed will be more or less than the target
// amount of time passed for the current height. To counteract this, the target
// block time for each block is adjusted based on how far away from the desired
// total time passed the current total time passed is. If the total time passed
// is too low, blocks are targeted to be slightly longer, which helps to correct
// the network. And if the total time passed is too high, blocks are targeted to
// be slightly shorter, to help correct the network.
//
// High variance in block times means that the corrective action should not be
// very strong if the total time passed has only missed the target time passed
// by a few hours. But if the total time passed is significantly off, the block
// time corrections should be much stronger. The square of the total deviation
// is used to figure out what the adjustment should be. At 10,000 seconds
// variance (about 3 hours), blocks will be adjusted by 10 seconds each. At
// 20,000 seconds, blocks will be adjusted by 40 seconds each, a 4x adjustment
// for 2x the error. And at 40,000 seconds, blocks will be adjusted by 160
// seconds each, and so on.
//
// The total amount of blocktime adjustment is capped to 1/3 and 3x the target
// blocktime, to prevent too much disruption on the network. If blocks are
// actually coming out 3x as fast as intended, there will be a (temporary)
// significant increase on the amount of strain on nodes to process blocks. And
// at 1/3 the target blocktime, the total blockchain throughput will decrease
// dramatically.
//
// Finally, one extra cap is applied to the difficulty adjustment - the
// difficulty of finding a block is not allowed to change more than 0.4% every
// block. This maps to a total possible difficulty change of 55x across 1008
// blocks. This clamp helps to prevent wild swings when the hashrate increases
// or decreases rapidly on the network, and it also limits the amount of damange
// that a malicious attacker can do if performing a difficulty raising attack.

// childTargetOak sets the child target based on the total time delta and total
// hashrate of the parent block. The deltas are known for the child block,
