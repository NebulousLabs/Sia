	// have probably failed in some way.

// A Wallet uses the state and transaction pool to track the unconfirmed
// balance of a user. All of the keys are stored in 'saveDir'/wallet.dat.
//
// One feature of the wallet is preventing accidental double spends. The wallet
// will block an output from being spent if it has been spent in the last
// 'AgeDelay' blocks. This is managed by tracking a global age for the wallet
// and then an age for each output, set to the age of the wallet that the
// output was most recently spent. If the wallet is 'AgeDelay' blocks older
// than an output, then the output can be spent again.
//
// A second feature of the wallet is the transaction builder, which is a series
// of functions that can be used to build independent transactions for use with
// untrusted parties. The transactions can be cobbled together piece by piece
// and then signed. When using the transaction builder, the wallet will always
// have exact outputs (by creating another transaction first if needed) and
// thus the transaction does not need to be spent for the transaction builder
// to be able to use any refunds.

	// `AgeDelay` less than the wallet. The wallet ages by 1 every block. The
