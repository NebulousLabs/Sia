// update.go is responsible for finding new hosts and adding them to the
// database. Currently, the blockchain is the only source for finding hosts,
// and any host announcement in the blockchain is accepted with equal weight.
// The current implementation is trivially vulnerable to a sybil attack,
// whereby a host can gain favoritism by announcing itself many times using
// different addresses. We have chosen to ignore this vulnerability for the
// early stages of the network, though eventually it will be addressed by
// requiring hosts to burn coins, and weighting them according to the number of
// coins burned.
