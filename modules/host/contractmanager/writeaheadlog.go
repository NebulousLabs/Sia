		// This I/O must be nonblocking and must resume in the event of unclean
		// or early shutdown.
		//
		// When the preprocessing is complete, the storage folder is moved to a
		// 'StorageFolderAddition', which can be safely applied to the contract
		// manager but hasn't yet.
		//
		// ErroredStorageFolderAdditions are signals to the WAL that an
		// unfinished storage folder addition has failed and can be cleared
		// out. The WAL is append-only, which is why an error needs to be
		// logged instead of just automatically clearning out the unfinished
		// storage folder addition.

		// file continuously for performance reasons - when a Sync() ->
		// Rename() occurs, most of the data will have already been flushed to
		// disk, making the operation faster. The same is done with the
		// settings file, which might be multiple MiB large for larger storage
		// arrays.
		//
		// To further increase throughput, the WAL will batch as many
		// operations as possible. These operations can happen concurrently,
		// and will block until the contract manager can provide an ACID
		// guarantee that the operation has completed. Syncing of multiple
		// operations happens all at once, and the syncChan is used to signal
		// that a sync operation has completed, providing ACID guarantees to
		// any operation waiting on it. The mechanism of announcing is to close
		// the syncChan, and then to create a new one for new operations to
		// listen on.

		// suggested or queued to be made to the state, but are not yet
