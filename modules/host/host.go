// TODO: Test the safety of the builder, it should be okay to have multiple
// builders open for up to 600 seconds, which means multiple blocks could be
// received in that time period. Should also check what happens if a prent gets
// confirmed on the blockchain before the builder is finished.

// TODO: Would be nice to have some sort of error transport to the user, so
// that the user is notified in ways other than logs via the host that there
// are issues such as disk, etc.

// TODO: automated_settings.go, a file which can be responsible for
// automatically regulating things like bandwidth price, storage price,
// contract price, etc. One of the features in consideration is that the host
// would start to steeply increase the contract price as it begins to run low
// on collateral. The host would also inform the user that there doesn't seem
// to be enough money to handle all of the file contracts, so that the user
// could make a judgement call on whether to get more.

// TODO: The host needs to somehow keep an awareness of its bandwidth limits,
// and needs to reject calls if there is not enough bandwidth available.

// TODO: The synchronization on the port forwarding is not perfect. Sometimes a
// port will be cleared before it was set (if things happen fast enough),
// because the port forwarding call is asynchronous.

// TODO: Add contract compensation from form contract to the storage obligation
// financial metrics, and to the host's tracking.

// TODO: merge the network interfaces stuff, don't forget to include the
// 'announced' variable as one of the outputs.

// TODO: check that the host is doing proper clean shudown, especially
// network.go, a couple of problems with clean shutdown in network.go.

// TODO: 'announced' doesn't tell you if the announcement made it to the
// blockchain.

// TODO: Need to make sure that the revision exchange for the renter and the
// host is being handled correctly. For the host, it's not so difficult. The
// host need only send the most recent revision every time. But, the host
// should not sign a revision unless the renter has explicitly signed such that
// the 'WholeTransaction' fields cover only the revision and that the
// signatures for the revision don't depend on anything else. The renter needs
// to verify the same when checking on a file contract revision from the host.
// If the host has submitted a file contract revision where the signatures have
// signed the whole file contract, there is an issue.

// TODO: there is a mistake in the file contract revision rpc, the host, if it
// does not have the right file contract id, should be returning an error there
// to the renter (and not just to it's calling function without informing the
// renter what's up).

// TODO: Need to make sure that the correct height is being used when adding
// sectors to the storage manager - in some places right now WindowStart is
// being used but really it's WindowEnd that should be in use.

// TODO: clean up all of the magic numbers in the host.

// TODO: revamp the finances for the storage obligations.

// TODO: host_test.go has commented out tests.

// TODO: network_test.go has commented out tests.

// TODO: persist_test.go has commented out tests.

// TODO: update_test.go has commented out tests.
