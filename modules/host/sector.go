// TODO: Write a sector consistency check - every sector in the host database
// should be represented by a sector on disk, and vice-versa. This is closer to
// a testing check, because the host is tolerant of disk corruption - it is
// okay for there to be information in the sector usage struct that cannot be
// retrieved from the disk. The consistency check should return information on
// how much corruption there is an what shape it takes. If there are files
// found on disk that are not represented in the usage struct, those files
// should be reported as well. The consistency check should be acoompanied by a
// 'purge' mode (perhaps multiple modes) which will delete any files in the
// storage folders which are not represented in the sector usage database.
//
// A simliar check should exist for verifying that the host has the correct
// folder structure. All of the standard files, plus all of the storage
// folders, nothing more. This check belongs in storagefolders.go
//
// A final check, the obligations check, should verify that every sector in the
// sector usage database is represented correctly by the storage obligations,
// and that every sector in the storage obligations is represented by the
// sector usage database.
//
// Disk inconsistencies should be handled by returning errors when trying to
// read from the filesystem, which means the problem manifests at the lowest
// level, the sector level. Because data is missing, there is no 'repair'
// operation that can be supported. The sector usage database should match the
// storage obligation database, and should be patched if there's a mismatch.
// The storage obligation database gets preference. Any missing sectors will be
// treated as if they were filesystem problems.
//
// The consistency check should be wary of 'SizeRemaining' when it is trying to
// do cleanup - if sector removals fail, SizeRemaining should not update as
// though the sectors are gone (but should also be correct such that it's the
// size of the real sectors + the size of the unremovable files - calculated,
// not relative)

// TODO: Write an RPC that lets the host share which sectors it has lost.

// TODO: Make sure the host will not stutter if it needs to perform operations
// on sectors that have been manually deleted.

// second on each of an obscene number of machines. Potential collisions for
// sectors are limited because hosts have secret data that the attacker does
// not know which is used to salt the transformation of a sector hash to a
// sectorID. As a result, an attacker is limited in the number of times they
// can try to cause a collision - one random shot every time they upload a
// sector, and the attacker has limited ability to learn of the success of the
// attempt. Uploads are very slow, even on fast machines there will be less
// than 1000 per second. It is therefore safe to reduce the security from
