// Package gateway connects a Sia node to the Sia flood network. The flood
// network is used to propagate blocks and transactions. The gateway is the
// primary avenue that a node uses to hear about transactions and blocks, and
// is the primary avenue used to tell the network about blocks that you have
// mined or about transactions that you have created.

// For the user to be securely connected to the network, the user must be
// connected to at least one node which will send them all of the blocks. An
// attacker can trick the user into thinking that a different blockchain is the
// full blockchain if the user is not connected to any nodes who are seeing +
// broadcasting the real chain (and instead is connected only to attacker nodes
// or to nodes that are not broadcasting). This situation is called an eclipse
// attack.
//
// Connecting to a large number of nodes increases the resiliancy of the
// network, but also puts a networking burden on the nodes and can slow down
// block propagation or increase orphan rates. The gateway's job is to keep the
// network efficient while also protecting the user against attacks.
//
// The gateway keeps a list of nodes that it knows about. It uses this list to
// form connections with other nodes, and then uses those connections to
// participate in the flood network. The primary vector for an attacker to
// achieve an eclipse attack is node list domination. If a gateway's nodelist
// is heavily dominated by attacking nodes, then when the gateway chooses to
// make random connections the gateway is at risk of selecting only attacker
// nodes.
//
// The gateway defends itself from these attacks by minimizing the amount of
// control that an attacker has over the node list and peer list. The first
// major defense is that the gateway maintains 8 'outbound' relationships,
// which means that the gateway created those relationships instead of an
// attacker. If a node forms a connection to you, that node is called
// 'inbound', and because it may be an attacker node, it is not trusted.
// Outbound nodes can also be attacker nodes, but they are less likely to be
// attacker nodes because you chose them, instead of them choosing you.
//
// If the gateway forms too many connections, the gateway will allow incoming
// connections by kicking an existing peer. But, to limit the amount of control
// that an attacker may have, only inbound peers are selected to be kicked.
// Furthermore, to increase the difficulty of attack, if a new inbound
// connection shares the same IP address as an existing connection, the shared
// connection is the connection that gets dropped (unless that connection is a
// local or outbound connection).
//
// Nodes are added to a peerlist in two methods. The first method is that a
// gateway will ask its outbound peers for a list of nodes. If the node list is
// below a certain size (see consts.go), the gateway will repeatedly ask
// outbound peers to expand the list. Nodes are also added to the nodelist
// after they successfully form a connection with the gateway. To limit the
// attacker's ability to add nodes to the nodelist, connections are
// ratelimited. An attacker with lots of IP addresses still has the ability to
// fill up the nodelist, however getting 90% dominance of the nodelist requires
// forming thousands of connections, which will take hours or days. By that
// time, the attacked node should already have its set of outbound peers,
// limiting the amount of damage that the attacker can do.
//
// To limit DNS-based tomfoolry, nodes are only added to the nodelist if their
// connection information takes the form of an IP address.

// TODO: Currently the gateway does not do much in terms of bucketing. The
// gateway should make sure that it has outbound peers from a wide range of IP
// addresses, and when kicking inbound peers it shouldn't just favor kicking
// peers of the same IP address, it should favor kicking peers of the same ip
// address range.
//
// TODO: There is no public key exchange, so communications cannot be
// effectively encrypted or authenticated.
//
// TODO: Gateway hostname discovery currently has significant centralization,
// namely the fallback is a single third-party website that can easily form any
// response it wants. Instead, multiple TLS-protected third party websites
// should be used, and the plurality answer should be accepted as the true
// hostname.
//
// TODO: The gateway currently does hostname discovery in a non-blocking way,
// which means that the first few peers that it connects to may not get the
// correct hostname. This means that you may give the remote peer the wrong
// hostname, which means they will not be able to dial you back, which means
// they will not add you to their node list.
//
// TODO: The gateway should encrypt and authenticate all communications. Though
// the gateway participates in a flood network, practical attacks have been
// demonstrated which have been able to confuse nodes by manipulating messages
// from their peers. Encryption + authentication would have made the attack
// more difficult.
