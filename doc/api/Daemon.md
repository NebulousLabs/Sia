Daemon API
===========

This document contains detailed descriptions of the daemon's API routes. For an
overview of the daemon's API routes, see [API.md#daemon](/doc/API.md#daemon).
For an overview of all API routes, see [API.md](/doc/API.md)

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not
guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used
in production.

Overview
--------

The daemon is responsible for starting and stopping the modules which make up
the rest of Sia. It also provides endpoints for viewing build constants.
