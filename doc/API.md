Siad API
========

The siad API is currently under construction. The deprecated way of doing
things is documented at the end of the (incomplete) new documentation. The new
documentation is a spec for the 0.4.0 api. After a round of fixes and
improvments for 0.4.1, the API will be frozen into 'compatibility mode', such
that backwards compatibility is preserved with all apps in future upgrades. The
api may change again when 1.0.0 is released.

The types.Currency object is an infinite precision unsigned integer that gets
represented in json as a base-10 string.

Consensus
---------

Queries:

* /consensus [GET]

#### /consensus [GET]

Function: Returns information about the consensus set, such as the current
block height.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	Height       types.BlockHeight (uint64)
	CurrentBlock types.BlockID     (string)
	Target       types.Target      (byte array)
}
```
'Height' is the number of blocks in the blockchain.

'CurrentBlock' is the hash of the current block.

'Target' is the hash that needs to be met by a block for the block to be valid.
The target is inversely proportional to the difficulty.

Wallet
------

Queries:

* /wallet                      [GET]
* /wallet/address              [GET]
* /wallet/backup               [POST]
* /wallet/encrypt              [POST]
* /wallet/lock                 [POST]
* /wallet/seeds                [GET]
* /wallet/seeds                [POST]
* /wallet/siacoins             [POST]
* /wallet/siafunds             [POST]
* /wallet/transaction/$(id)    [GET]
* /wallet/transactions         [GET]
* /wallet/transactions/$(addr) [GET]
* /wallet/unlock               [POST]

The first time that the wallet is ever created, the wallet will be unencrypted
and locked. The wallet must be encrypted using a call to /wallet/encrypt. After
encrypting the wallet, the wallet must be unlocked. From that point forward
(including restarting siad), the wallet will be encrypted, and only the call to
/wallet/unlock will be needed.

#### /wallet [GET]

Function: Returns basic information about the wallet, such as whether the
wallet is locked or unlocked.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	encrypted bool
	unlocked  bool

	confirmedsiacoinbalance     types.Currency (string)
	unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins types.Currency (string)
	unconfirmedincomingsiacoins types.Currency (string)

	siafundbalance      types.Currency (string)
	siacoinclaimBalance types.Currency (string)
}
```
'encrypted' indicates whether the wallet has been encrypted or not. If the
wallet has not been encrypted, then no data has been generated at all, and the
first time the wallet is unlocked, the password given will be used as the
password for encrypting all of the data. 'encrypted' will only be set to false
if the wallet has never been unlocked before (the unlocked wallet is still
encryped - but the encryption key is in memory).

'unlocked' indicates whether the wallet is currently locked or unlocked. Some
calls become unavailable when the wallet is locked.

'confirmedsiacoinbalance' is the number of siacoins available to the wallet as
of the most recent block in the blockchain.

'unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins' is the number of siacoins that are leaving the
wallet according to the set of unconfirmed transactions. Often this number
appears inflated, because outputs are frequently larger than the number of
coins being sent, and there is a refund. These coins are counted as outgoing,
and the refund is counted as incoming. The difference in balance can be
calculated using 'unconfirmedincomingsiacoins' - 'unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins'

'unconfirmedincomingsiacoins' is the number of siacoins are entering the wallet
according to the set of unconfirmed transactions. This number is often inflated
by outgoing siacoins, because outputs are frequently larger than the amount
being sent. The refund will be included in the unconfirmed incoming siacoins
balance.

'siafundbalance' is the number of siafunds available to the wallet as
of the most recent block in the blockchain.

'siacoinclaimbalance' is the number of siacoins that can be claimed from the
siafunds as of the most recent block. Because the claim balance increases every
time a file contract is created, it is possible that the balance will increase
before any claim transaction is confirmed.

#### /wallet/address [GET]

Function: Get a new address from the wallet generated by the primary seed. An
error will be returned if the wallet is locked.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	address types.UnlockHash (string)
}
```
'address' is a Sia address that can receive siacoins or siafunds.

#### /wallet/backup [POST]

Function: Create a backup of the wallet settings file. Though this can easily
be done manually, the settings file is often in an unknown or difficult to find
location. The /wallet/backup call can spare users the trouble of needing to
find their wallet file.

Parameters:
```
filepath string
```
'filepath' is the on-disk location that the file is going to be saved.

Response: standard

#### /wallet/encrypt [POST]

Function: Encrypt the wallet. After the wallet has been encrypted once, it does
not need to be encrypted again, and future calls to /wallet/encrypt will return
an error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password
is blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed.

Parameters:
```
encryptionpassword string
dictionary string
```
'encryptionpassword' is the password that will be used to encrypt the wallet.
All subsequent calls should use this password. If left blank, the seed that
gets returned will also be the encryption password.

'dictionary' is the name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding
the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.

Response:
```
struct {
	primaryseed string
}
```
'primaryseed' is the dictionary encoded seed that is used to generate addresses
that the wallet is able to spend.

#### /wallet/lock [POST]

Function: Locks the wallet, wiping all secret keys. After being locked, the
keys are encrypted. Queries for the seed, to send siafunds, and related queries
become unavailable. Queries concerning transaction history and balance are
still available.

Parameters: none

Response: Standard.

#### /wallet/seeds [GET]

Function: Return a list of seeds in use by the wallet. The primary seed is the
only seed that gets used to generate new addresses. This call is unavailable
when the wallet is locked.

Parameters:
```
dictionary string
```
'dictionary' is the name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding
the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.

Response:
```
struct {
	primaryseed        mnemonics.Phrase   (string)
	addressesremaining int
	allseeds           []mnemonics.Phrase (array of strings)
}
```
'primaryseed' is the seed that is actively being used to generate new addresses
for the wallet.

'addressesremaining' is the number of addresses that remain in the primary seed
until exhaustion has been reached. Once exhaustion has been reached, new
addresses will continue to be generated but they will be more difficult to
recover in the event of a lost wallet file or encryption password.

'allseeds' is a list of all seeds that the wallet references when scanning the
blockchain for outputs. The wallet is able to spend any output generated by any
of the seeds, however only the primary seed is being used to generate new
addresses.

A seed is an encoded version of a 128 bit random seed. The output is 15 words
chosen from a small dictionary as indicated by the input. The most common
choice for the dictionary is going to be 'english'. The underlying seed is the
same no matter what dictionary is used for the encoding. The encoding also
contains a small checksum of the seed, to help catch simple mistakes when
copying. The library
[entropy-mnemonics](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/entropy-mnemonics) is used
when encoding.

#### /wallet/seeds [POST]

Function: Give the wallet a seed to track when looking for incoming
transactions. The wallet will be able to spend outputs related to addresses
created by the seed. The seed is added as an auxiliary seed, and does not
replace the primary seed. Only the primary seed will be used for generating new
addresses.

Parameters:
```
encryptionpassword string
dictionary         string
seed               string
```
'encryptionpassword' is the key that is used to encrypt the new seed when it is
saved to disk.

'dictionary' is the name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding
the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.

'seed' is the dictionary-encoded phrase that corresponds to the seed being
added to the wallet.

Response: standard

#### /wallet/siacoins [POST]

Function: Send siacoins to an address. The outputs are arbitrarily selected
from addresses in the wallet.

Parameters:
```
amount      int
destination string
```
'amount' is the number of siacoins being sent.

'destination' is the address that is receiving the coins.

Response:
```
struct {
	transactionids []types.TransactionID (string)
}
```
'transactionids' are the ids of the transactions that were created when sending
the coins. The last transaction contains the output headed to the
'destination'.

#### /wallet/siafunds [POST]

Function: Send siafunds to an address. The outputs are arbitrarily selected
from addresses in the wallet. Any siacoins available in the siafunds being sent
(as well as the siacoins available in any siafunds that end up in a refund
address) will become available to the wallet as siacoins after 144
confirmations. To access all of the siacoins in the siacoin claim balance, send
all of the siafunds to an address in your control (this will give you all the
siacoins, while still letting you control the siafunds).

Parameters:
```
amount      int
destination string
```
'amount' is the number of siafunds being sent.

'destination' is the address that is receiving the funds.

Response:
```
struct {
	transactionids []types.TransactionID (string)
}
```
'transactionids' are the ids of the transactions that were created when sending
the coins. The last transaction contains the output headed to the
'destination'.

#### /wallet/transaction/$(id) [GET]

Function: Get the transaction associated with a specific transaction id.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	transaction modules.ProcessedTransaction
}
```

Processed transactions are transactions that have been processed by the wallet
and given more information, such as a confirmation height and a timestamp.
Processed transactions will always be returned in chronological order.

A processed transaction takes the following form:
```
struct modules.ProcessedTransaction {
	transaction           types.Transaction
	transactionid         types.TransactionID (string)
	confirmationheight    types.BlockHeight   (int)
	confirmationtimestamp types.Timestamp     (uint64)

	processedinputs  []modules.ProcessedInput
	processedoutputs []modules.ProcessedOutput
}
```
'transaction' is a types.Transaction, and is defined in types.transaction.go

'transactionid' is the id of the transaction from which the wallet transaction
was derived.

'confirmationheight' is the height at which the transaction was confirmed. The
height will be set to 'uint64max' if the transaction has not been confirmed.

'confirmationtimestamp' is the time at which a transaction was confirmed. The
timestamp is an unsigned 64bit unix timestamp, and will be set to 'uint64max'
if the transaction is unconfirmed.

'processedinputs' is an array of processed inputs detailing the inputs to the
transaction. More information below.

'processedoutputs' is an array of processed outputs detailing the outputs of
the transaction. Outputs related to file contracts are excluded.

A modules.ProcessedInput takes the following form:
```
struct modules.ProcessedInput {
	fundtype       types.Specifier  (string)
	walletaddress  bool
	relatedaddress types.UnlockHash (string)
	value          types.Currency   (string)
}
```

'fundtype' indicates what type of fund is represented by the input. Inputs can
be of type 'MinerPayout', 'SiacoinInput', and 'SiafundInput'. Miner payouts and
siacoin inputs both add siacoins to the transaction. Siafund inputs add
siafunds to the transaction.

'walletaddress' indicates whether the address is owned by the wallet.
 
'relatedaddress' is the address that is affected. For inputs (outgoing money),
the related address is usually not important because the wallet arbitrarily
selects which addresses will fund a transaction. For outputs (incoming money),
the related address field can be used to determine who has sent money to the
wallet.

'value' indicates how much money has been moved in the input or output.

A modules.ProcessedOutput takes the following form:
```
struct modules.ProcessedOutput {
	fundtype       types.Specifier   (string)
	maturityheight types.BlockHeight (int)
	walletaddress  bool
	relatedaddress types.UnlockHash  (string)
	value          types.Currency    (string)
}
```

'fundtype' indicates what type of fund is represented by the output. Outputs
can be of type 'SiacoinOutput', 'SiafundOutput', and 'ClaimOutput'. Siacoin
outputs and claim outputs both relate to siacoins. Siafund outputs relate to
siafunds.

'maturityheight' indicates what height the output becomes available to be
spent. Siacoin outputs and siafund outputs mature immediately - their maturity
height will always be the confirmation height of the transaction. Claim outputs
cannot be spent until they have had 144 confirmations, thus the maturity height
of a claim output will always be 144 larger than the confirmation height of the
transaction.

'walletaddress' indicates whether the address is owned by the wallet.
 
'relatedaddress' is the address that is affected.

'value' indicates how much money has been moved in the input or output.

#### /wallet/transactions [GET]

Function: Return a list of transactions related to the wallet.

Parameters:
```
startheight types.BlockHeight (uint64)
endheight   types.BlockHeight (uint64)
```
'startheight' refers to the height of the block where transaction history
should begin.

'endheight' refers to the height of of the block where the transaction history
should end. If 'endheight' is greater than the current height, all transactions
up to and including the most recent block will be provided.

Response:
```
struct {
	confirmedhistory   []modules.ProcessedTransaction
	unconfirmedhistory []modules.ProcessedTransaction
}
```
'confirmedhistory' lists all of the confirmed transactions appearing between
height 'startheight' and height 'endheight' (inclusive).

'unconfirmedhistory' lists all of the unconfirmed transactions.

#### /wallet/transactions/$(addr) [GET]

Function: Return all of the transaction related to a specific address.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	transactions []modules.ProcessedTransaction.
}
```
'transactions' is a list of processed transactions that relate to the input
address.  See the documentation for '/wallet/transaction' for more information.

#### /wallet/unlock [POST]

Function: Unlock the wallet. The wallet is capable of knowing whether the
correct password was provided.

Parameters:
```
encryptionpassword string
```
'encryptionpassword' is the password that gets used to decrypt the file. Most
frequently, the encryption password is the same as the primary wallet seed.

Response: standard

Siad API (Deprecated)
=====================

All API calls return JSON objects. If there is an error, the error is returned
in plaintext with an appropriate HTTP error code. The standard response is {
"Success": true }. In this document, the API responses are defined as Go
structs. The structs will be encoded to JSON before being sent; they are used
here to provide type information.

At version 0.4, the API will be locked into forwards compatibility. This means
that we will not add new required parameters or remove response fields. We may,
however, add additional fields and optional parameters, and we may disable
parameters. It should be noted that significant changes in the API are planned
between 0.3.3.2 and 0.4.

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not
guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used
in production.

The default port for the API is "localhost:9980". This can be changed using the
'-a' flag when running siad.

Miner
-----

Queries:

* /miner/blockforwork
* /miner/start
* /miner/status
* /miner/stop
* /miner/submitblock

#### /miner/blockforwork

Function: Provides a block that is ready for the blockchain except for having
an invalid target. An external miner is expected to try nonces until a block
with a valid target is found. Every block returned by this call will have a
unique hash - miners can start at nonce 0 without worrying about trying the
same block twice.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
[]byte
```
The response is a byte array containing a targe followed by a block header
followed by a block. The target is the first 32 bytes. The block header is the
following 80 bytes, and the nonce is bytes 32-39 (inclusive) of the header
(bytes 64-71 of the whole array). The remaining bytes are the block. Hashing
the header will result in the block id, which must be lower than the target.
When submitting a solved block, you need to update the nonce in the block. The
nonce is at bytes 32-39 (inclusive) of the block, or bytes 144-151 of the whole
field. When submitting the block to /miner/submitblock, only submit the block
and not the target or header.

Layout:

0-31: target

32-111: header

112+: block

32-39 of header: header nonce

32-39 of block: block nonce

When submitting the block, update the nonce and submit only the block (bytes
112+).

#### /miner/start

Function: Tells the miner to begin mining on `threads` threads.

Parameters:
```
threads int
```

Response: standard

#### /miner/status

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	Mining         bool
	State          string
	Threads        int
	RunningThreads int
	Address        [32]byte
}
```
If the `Mining` flag is set, the miner is currently mining. Otherwise it is
not.

`State` gives a more nuanced description of the miner, including
transitional states.

`Threads` indicates the number of desired threads, while
`RunningThreads` is the number of currently active threads. If the miner finds
a block,

`Address` is the address that will receive the coinbase.

#### /miner/stop

Function: Stops the miner.

Parameters: none

Response: standard

#### /miner/submitblock

Function: Submits a block to the miner. The block is submitted as an encoded
byte slice. The block does not need to be modified from the block provided by
/miner/blockforwork except that the nonce must be updated. The nonce can be
found at bytes 32-39 (inclusive) of the block.

Response Body:
```
[]byte
```

Response: standard

Renter
