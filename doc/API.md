Siad API
========

All API calls return JSON objects. If there is an error, the error is returned
in plaintext with an appropriate HTTP error code. The standard response is {
"Success": true }. In this document, the API responses are defined as Go
structs. The structs will be encoded to JSON before being sent; they are used
here to provide type information.

At version 0.4, the API will be locked into forwards compatibility. This means
that we will not add new required parameters or remove response fields. We
may, however, add additional fields and optional parameters, and we may
disable parameters.

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not
guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used
in production.

The default port for the API is "localhost:9980". This can be changed using the
'-a' flag when running siad.

`maxFilesize` is the maximum allowed file size.

`minDuration` is the minimum amount of time a contract is allowed to last.

`maxDuration` is the maximum amount of time a contract is allowed to last.

`windowSize` is the number of blocks a host has to prove they are holding the

`collateral` is the amount of collateral the host will offer (in Hastings per
byte per block) for losing files on the network.

Response: standard

Miner
-----

Queries:

* /miner/blockforwork
* /miner/start
* /miner/status
* /miner/stop
* /miner/submitblock

#### /miner/blockforwork

Function: Provides a block that is ready for the blockchain except for having
an invalid target. An external miner is expected to try nonces until a block
with a valid target is found. Every block returned by this call will have a
unique hash - miners can start at nonce 0 without worrying about trying the
same block twice.

Parameters: none

Response:
```
[]byte
```
The response is a byte array containing a targe followed by a block header
followed by a block. The target is the first 32 bytes. The block header is the
following 80 bytes, and the nonce is bytes 32-39 (inclusive) of the header
(bytes 64-71 of the whole array). The remaining bytes are the block. Hashing
the header will result in the block id, which must be lower than the target.
When submitting a solved block, you need to update the nonce in the block. The
nonce is at bytes 32-39 (inclusive) of the block, or bytes 144-151 of the whole
field. When submitting the block to /miner/submitblock, only submit the block
and not the target or header.

Layout:

0-31: target

32-111: header

112+: block

32-39 of header: header nonce

32-39 of block: block nonce

When submitting the block, update the nonce and submit only the block (bytes
112+).

#### /miner/start

Function: Tells the miner to begin mining on `threads` threads.

Parameters:
```
threads int
```

Response: standard

#### /miner/status

Parameters: none

Response:
```
struct {
	Mining         bool
	State          string
	Threads        int
	RunningThreads int
	Address        [32]byte
}
```
If the `Mining` flag is set, the miner is currently mining. Otherwise it is
not.

`State` gives a more nuanced description of the miner, including
transitional states.

`Threads` indicates the number of desired threads, while
`RunningThreads` is the number of currently active threads. If the miner finds
a block,

`Address` is the address that will receive the coinbase.

#### /miner/stop

Function: Stops the miner.

Parameters: none

Response: standard

#### /miner/submitblock

Function: Submits a block to the miner. The block is submitted as an encoded
byte slice. The block does not need to be modified from the block provided by
/miner/blockforwork except that the nonce must be updated. The nonce can be
found at bytes 32-39 (inclusive) of the block.

Response Body:
```
[]byte
```

Response: standard

Renter
------

Queries:

}
```
Each file in the queue is represented by the above struct.

`Complete` indicates whether the file is ready to be used. Note that `Received
== Filesize` does not imply `Complete`, because the file may require
additional processing (e.g. decryption) after all of the raw bytes have been
downloaded.

`Filesize` is the size of the file being download.

`Received` is the number of bytes downloaded thus far.

`Destination` is the path that the file was downloaded to.

`Nickname` is the nickname given to the file when it was uploaded.

#### /renter/files/delete

nickname string
```
`nickname` is the nickname of the file that has been uploaded to the network.

Response: standard

#### /renter/files/download

Each uploaded file is represented by the above struct.

`Available` indicates whether or not the file can be downloaded immediately.
