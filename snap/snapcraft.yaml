  Sia is a new decentralized cloud storage platform that radically alters the
  landscape of cloud storage. By leveraging smart contracts, client-side
  encryption, and sophisticated redundancy (via Reed-Solomon codes), Sia allows
  users to safely store their data with hosts that they do not know or trust.
